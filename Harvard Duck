## Explanation
- **Why Harvard CS50 used the Mascot of a duck (the rubber duck)? This yellow duck actually represents the concept of Rubber Duck Debugging**
- **In Harvard's CS50 course, the duck emoji ðŸ¦† originates from a teaching method called "rubber duck debugging." As if instructing, this approach asks students to describe their code or issue aloud to a rubber duck (or, in the case of the course, a symbolic duck emoji). The premise is that by breaking down the problem into its component parts, programmers can frequently find errors or new information without further assistance.**
