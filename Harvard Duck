## 💡 **Explanation**  
### 🐤 **Why Does CS50 Use the Rubber Duck Mascot?**  
Harvard's CS50 course adopted the **rubber duck** symbol to teach the concept of **Rubber Duck Debugging**.  

In this technique:
- 🗣️ Students are encouraged to **explain their code or issues aloud** to a rubber duck (or symbolically, the 🦆 emoji).  
- 🧩 **Breaking down the problem** into smaller parts often helps **uncover bugs** or highlight new insights.  
- 🛠️ It’s a self-debugging method, allowing programmers to solve issues without relying on external help.
